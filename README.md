Project Wildfire

by Natalie Dreher, Ronald Durham, Grant Fairbairn

This project is an analysis of the wildfire dataset taken in the United States from 1992 to 2015

Over this timeframe, roughly 1.88 million occurrences of wildfires in the United States were recorded containing a vast set of attributes per each fire. The attributes cover topics like discovery date, containment size, fire size, geographic location, and start cause. Our version of the data is the 3rd update of this publication that supports the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. Our team decided to analyze this dataset to examine whether there are any noteworthy patterns between the fire attributes over time. 

1. Have wildfires become more or less frequent over time?
	Generally, there is no correlation between number of fires over time.
2. In this dataset, what is the most common cause of fires?
	The cause of debris burning is the most common cause by a long shot, however, that category is quite vague. 
3. Which cause of fire most commonly leads to the largest fire size?
	Lightning strikes notably cause the largest fires. 
	
Possibly the largest area of application of this dataset would be in learning about prevention and containment. Wildfires are actually a necessary part of our global ecosystem. They allow forests to clear out the deadfall and sick trees to allow for new growth. Our issue comes when we incorporate our lives deep within forests and become susceptible to the natural proceses of nature. Wildfires are not something that should be viewed as being able to be eliminated completely but rather understood and worked with cooperatively. By identifying the common location and causes, we can position our homes and businesses outside of these zones and be prepared with barriers to protect the facilities within those zones.
